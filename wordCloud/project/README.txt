To create images with custom shape on a custom background

-Save background image (in this example its a picture of a moon)
-Create a copy of the background image
-Color in black the shape you want the algorithm to place pictures in
-Save foreground image (in this example, the moon is black, meaning the algorithm will only place words in the moon)
-For custom shape option, choose the foreground image (black moon)
-For custom background option, choose original background image
NOTE: MAKE SURE DIMENSIONS MATCH THE BACKGROUND AND FOREGROUND IMAGE AS ALGORITHM DOES NOT RESIZE THE BACKGROUND
